 game_concept_possession_desc:0 "the process through which a Wraith takes ownership of a body. Whether or not possession succeeds depends on a duel between the wraith and the victim. Possession is divided into three stages and can be used several times against the same person (if you use the same wraith, of course). If a ghost bound to you possesses a victim, the target shall likewise be bound to you. Stages of possession: \n 1. In stage one, the victim gains some of the wraith's prowess on top of their own, and the necromancer and wraith gain influence over the victim. \n 2. Stage two imparts some of the Wraith's skills upon the victim, giving them a part of the ghost's stats. The necromancer gains more control over the victim. In addition, the personalities of the wraith and victim begin to meld together. \n 3. In stage three, the possession is complete, and the wraith's personality overwhelms the target. The Victim is enthralled by the wraith and gains more of its skills as the ghost acts through them. The necromancer's control grows even further."

 game_concept_obtenebration_desc:0 "Obtenebration, the power to control and manipulate shadows, is the [Concept('discipline','дисциплина')|E] from which the [Concept('clan','клан')|E] of Shadows takes its name. Initiates of the discipline can use it to move and manipulate shadows to their advantage, while masters can give shadows form, substance, and a semblance of life. The nature of the source of this power causes no end of disagreement among Lasombra. The most ancient elders of the [Concept('clan','клан')|E] claim that the darkness is itself a primal entity, equal and opposite to the force of creation that bears the world into being. Influenced by Zoroastrianism, the eldest usually call this dark force Ahriman. Other Lasombra believe that Obtenebration draws its power from a realm of shadow rather than an entity. Lasombra who look to one of the Abrahamic faiths might call it Hell, while an adherent of the ancient Greek or Roman gods might call it Tartarus. Whatever its origin, Obtenebration is wholly unnerving to those who see it in use. It evokes terror in animals or mortals who see the [Concept('discipline','дисциплина')|E] in use.
