The relation between the Noiads and their tribe was somewhat symbiotic: the Noiad would protect the tribe from enemies and act as a guide, shaman, and teacher to them, while the tribe gave willingly of their blood and sheltered the Noiad during the long months with no darkness. In times of famine, the Noaid would ghoul members of the tribe to ensure their survival. The Noiad dwelled openly among the Sámi, and Embraced exclusively from this population. Those selected for Embrace tended to be those with talent for divination, as well as dream and star interpretation. The Noiad also watched children descended from families that included at least one vampire, looking for the traits they favored. "
