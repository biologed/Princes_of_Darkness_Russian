 #Rakta-sadhu-Group Faiths
 raktasadhus:0 "Rakta-sadhus"
 raktasadhus_adj:0 "Rakta-sadhus"
 raktasadhus_adherent:0 "Rakta-sadhu"
 raktasadhus_adherent_plural:0 "Rakta-sadhus"
 raktasadhus_des:0 "The vampires of India practice a form of blood sorcery called Sadhana. Despite the fact that there are Indian Cainites who do not practice Sadhana, the plural term raktasadhus is still sometimes used to collectively refer to all Indian Cainites, largely because they have as of yet neglected to formalize their web of ephemeral allegiances into an actual sect or Court. Those allegiances might not even have come into existence at all though if it were not for the opposition from the Cathayan vampires of the Infinite Thunders Court of southern India and the Scarlet Dragon Court of eastern India."
 
 mayaparisatya:0 "Mayaparisatya"
 mayaparisatya_adj:0 "Mayaparisatya"
 mayaparisatya_adherent:0 "Rakshasa"
 mayaparisatya_adherent_plural:0 "Rakshasa"
 mayaparisatya_desc:0 "The Path of Paradox owes a heavy debt to certain tenets of Hinduism. According to it, Kindred are locked perpetually outside the illusory cycle of the universe (maya). Whereas most beings are reincarnated through saṃsāra, a continual entanglement in the cycle of rebirth, Kindred have eluded that cycle. Every individual has his own purpose, or svadharma, although vampires, excluded from the cycle, have lost theirs."

 viaparadox:0 "Path of Paradox"
 viaparadox_adj:0 "Paradox"
 viaparadox_adherent:0 "Deceiver"
 viaparadox_adherent_plural:0 "Deceivers"
 viaparadox_desc:0 "The Deceivers believe in a higher purpose for everyone, including themselves, other vampires, and mortals. Their task in life is to guide everyone to their higher destiny. If needed, this includes death, especially for Kindred they view as wayward and having fallen from their true destiny. Mortals are safer from these fatal punishments, as they are more directly involved with the life cycle of the universe."

 pathofdevaraja:0 "Path of Devaraja"
 pathofdevaraja_adj:0 "Devaraja"
 pathofdevaraja_adherent:0 "Divine"
 pathofdevaraja_adherent_plural:0 "Divines"
 pathofdevaraja_desc:0 "Followers of this path do not believe in some divine right to rule. Instead, they believe that they must earn the right to rule and rise to divinity in the eyes their people. The Divines do not create subjects and inferiors, but rather, followers and worshipers."

 pathofdaitya:0 "Path of Daitya"
 pathofdaitya_adj:0 "Daitya"
 pathofdaitya_adherent:0 "Snake-Charmer"
 pathofdaitya_adherent_plural:0 "Snake-Charmers"
 pathofdaitya_desc:0 "The Daitya revere Shiva, and claim leadership of all vampires who worship Shiva. The Daitya see their caste duty as a strange inverse of mortal Brahminism. As demons, they must fight the gods and strive to overthrow the moral order of the world. As Brahmins, however, they must strive to keep their fellow vampires within their own particular caste duties as murderers, tricksters, desecrators of sacred rites and all the other abhorrent roles assigned to demons."
 
 naktanchara:0 "Naktanchara"
 naktanchara_adj:0 "Naktanchara"
 naktanchara_adherent:0 "Naga"
 naktanchara_adherent_plural:0 "Nagas"
 naktanchara_desc:0 "Influenced by the rise of Buddhism among mortals, the Naktanchara bloodline broke away from the Path of Daitya to seek inner peace and Nirvana. The Naga now guard some forbidden texts of Buddhism such as the Prajnaparamita Sutras. Their respect is for the religion as a whole though, and not the individual practitioners. They also are worldly and temperamental creatures that spread disease and misfortune when angered."

 tariqeltanaqud_adherent_plural:0 "Al-Mukhadieun"
 tariqeltanaqud_desc:0 "As the crossroad between the main Indian line and the decadent Western one, the Muslim Ravnos straddle both worlds but are also rejected by both. Outcasts and wanderers, they are loathed by the Ashirra."

 samsara:0 "Samsara"
 samsara_adj:0 "Samsara"
 samsara_adherent:0 ""
 samsara_adherent_plural:0 ""
 samsara_desc:0 "The modern Path of Paradox, also called Saṃsāra, is a creation of Ravnos neonates. It is not as rigid as the Mayaparistya, but also does not allow the wanton cruelty and hedonism of the Western Path. Its Ethics are the same as the Mayaparistya, but the Hierarchy of Sins has been modified to allow for interaction with vampires who do not follow the path."
