The Ordos were dedicated to deciphering the scrying techniques of the Malkavians of old and unlock the potential within their madness to overcome the Beast. As such, only Malkavians were permitted into their ranks. They were splintered across the Old World in small cults, each independent and only identifiable through their methods."

 jocastian:0 "Jocastian"
 jocastian_adj:0 "Jocastian"

 jocastian_adherent_plural:0 "Jocastians"
 jocastian_desc:0 "A small and obscure sect (and possibly a Malkavian bloodline) who originated within the Sabbat as a Noddist cult, but who have since become independent. While most Jocastians are Malkavians, there are also some Brujah and other learned Kindred within their ranks. They are dedicated to unraveling the true history of the Cainites and are rivals to the Mnemosyne. Although some scholars regard them as a bloodline due to the practice that a master let himself be diablerized by a student in order to preserve the knowledge he has gathered, they are not any different from their parent clan."

 mnemosyne_adherent_plural:0 "Mystai"
 mnemosyne_desc:0 "The Mnemosyne, or Memory-Seekers, are a cult of Noddists comprised of Malkavian scholars; some suggest that the Mnemosyne are in fact a bloodline of the Malkavians. Their most prominent member is Aristotle de Laurent. Members of the cult seek knowledge of the history of Kindred, and most of them follow the Path of Caine. The cult is in conflict with the Jocastatians and, until recently, the Ventrue elder Bindusara. Its members practice a form of diablerie; when an elder thinks his time has come, he allows younger Kindred to diablerise him so that his knowledge may be passed on. This is the reason why the cult is sometimes called a bloodline. The cult is named after the Greek muse of memory."
