 viahumanitatis_adherent_plural:0 "Prodigals"
 viahumanitatis_desc:0 "Followers of Via Humanitatis use the human condition to fight their Beast, remembering that they were ordinary mortals before being bestowed with Caine's curse. They place an emphasis on human virtues, such as freedom, the human heart and soul, and on reason and intelligence as a separator of man from beast."

 viaanima:0 "Via Anima"
 viaanima_adj:0 "Anima"
 viaanima_adherent:0 "Inspired"
 viaanima_adherent_plural:0 "Inspired"
 viaanima_desc:0 "Via Anima is commonly called the Path of Breath. The Inspired try to find meaning and purpose among mortal men, sharing their burdens and daily lives. By doing so, they hope to cease being monsters in their own mind, and so stall off the Beast. Many who walk this path do so purely by instinct, never giving the matter much thought."

 viavireo_adherent_plural:0 "Rovers"

The Path of Vigor is a forceful and energetic path that emphasizes motion and action before contemplation and stillness."
