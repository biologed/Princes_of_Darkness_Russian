 POD_web_of_knives.1.desc:0 "You have been contacted by one of the Web of Knives elusive recruiter. There will be three trials under his supervision and the first one will be a 'simple' test of skill against him. Using sword or intrigue, you will have to impress him enough for the process to continue. You have the choice between these two types of assassin skills to demonstrate."

 POD_web_of_knives.3.desc:0 "You have been deemed unworthy during the trial. The Web of Knives won't work with you for now and you will have to wait some time before trying again, if that is something you even want to consider. Nothing of real value has been lost though, except a bit of pride."

 POD_web_of_knives.2.t:0 "Trial of Humanity"
 POD_web_of_knives.2.desc:0 "The second trial is actually quite simple. You must kill the specific mortal presented in front of you. No questions answered, no reasons given.\nJust senseless murder.\nClearly, they are testing if you are capable of following orders, no matter how brutal or idiotic they might seem. They also are probably judging your moral limits, as the members of the Web are known as very inhumane vampires."
 POD_web_of_knives.2.a:0 "Senseless murder it is"
 POD_web_of_knives.2.b:0 "This is going too far... for now"
 POD_web_of_knives.2.c:0 "This is going too far!"

 POD_web_of_knives.5.t:0 "Trial of Faith"
 POD_web_of_knives.5.desc:0 "The last trial is actually more of a pledge than anything else. The Web of Knives believes in a fanciful tale where Haqim embraced himself to fight against the 'Damned Children of Khayyin'. Their whole assassin business is merely a front to kill as much [cainites|E] as possible in impunity and slowly take over their whole [clan|E].\nClearly, they are demented and delusional... or are they? Perhaps there is something about a bloody unrepentant murderer cult that appeals to you. Or you could just pretend to believe in their fanciful tales... but they would clearly take grave offense if they ever find out."
 POD_web_of_knives.5.a:0 "Glory to Haqim!"
 POD_web_of_knives.5.b:0 "Glory to Haqim..."
