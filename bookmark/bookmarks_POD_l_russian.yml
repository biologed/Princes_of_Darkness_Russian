 bm_868_constantinoplebynight_desc:0 "Michael, the Patriarch of the Dream in Constantinople has been acting as the mortal Michael III. Dracon has lurched into a depression after the destruction of Antonius. Caius leads the Antonian Ventrue.  Narses, the Archbishop of Nod in Venice, looks to expand the Cainite Heresy to both the Byzantine east and the traditional Lasombra holdings to the south in Italy and Sicily.  Odin the All-High, leader of the Einherjar, is about to face a threat more fearsome than the Get of Fenrir --he must stand against the coming threat of mortals converting to the nailed god.  Meanwhile throughout western Europe, the Ventrue are a divided clan of competing fedual estates, the most powerful among them, Alexander of Paris. The olde Promethean Dominic sees an opportunity to revenge the fall of Carthage upon them from his base among the conquering Magyars. A house of mages, however, are about to turn Kindred society upside down by usurping the power of Caine's blood for themselves."

 bm_1230_warofprinces_desc:0 "The War of Princes is the period of conflict in Cainite history that began shortly after the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204. The term refers to the conflicts over territory that the various princes of Europe fought after the end of the Long Night.\n\nThe War of Princes began shortly before the Inquisition was formed. Although the Inquisitors were initially used as tools by the elders, they soon became a greater threat to the Cainites than the Cainites were to themselves. Although it is not clear exactly when the War of Princes ended, it would have likely been forced to a conclusion with the advent of the Anarch Revolt, if not sooner.\n\n#bold Will you alone stand as victor at this War's end? Or will the tide of humanity wash your clan away as they turn against their rightful masters?#!"

Although in a secure position and a powerful individual himself, trouble is brewing on Montano's horizon. The civil war in Iberia, the rise of old foes in Italy, and the unruliness of younger clan members are all threats to clan stability. Constantinople has recently bowed to him but its prince, Alfonzo, is certainly not to be trusted. The wiser course of action could be to stay focused on Italy for the time being. Be wary of ambitious vassals like Claudio Eugenio and the prince of Rome, Titus Venturus Camille.\n\n#bold Will you be able to secure Clan Lasombra's rightful position as the most influential clan of Europe once again?#!"

After destroying Carthage and laying the foundations of the Road of Sin, he succumbed to torpor.\n\n#bold Having recently awoken to a strange new world, will you rise to once again rule the entire Cainite world for the glory of a vibrant, decadent Rome?#!"

The Lioness of Jerusalem, childe of Samiel himself, is their last hope, their last chance at survival in the face of the Magister onslaught. Her alliance of Princes in the area, the 'Diet of Olives' is somewhat shaky though, and is already threatened by the nearby Ashirra and Baali. Making sure to secure her own power base would be a wise first move for the Salubri champion.\n\n#bold Will you transform a futile last stand into a glorious revival of the Salubri Clan?#!"

Now in exile as a shunned guest of the Black Cross, the powerful Methuselah is plotting his return. He has almost nothing to his name, except his impressive personal power and legitimacy... which counts for little in the grand scheme of things. It is almost a new start for the once    great childe of Ventrue.\n\n#bold Will you be able to make Geoffrey and Salianna pay for their betrayal and take back your rightful throne... or create a new legacy in these eastern lands?#!"

You have some advantages though, with the famed discipline of the Clan ensuring unity and the Ventrue of Germany and Hungary being somewhat on your side. Your foes aren't known for their patience, and you should look for opportunities to profit from their internal crisis.\n\n#bold Will you secure Clan Tremere as a powerful force in Vampire politics as Tremere decreed?#!"

Vladimir Rustovitch has had a mixed reign so far, with a white peace against the crusading Jurgen von Verden and the humiliating resilience of the hated Tremere. As is always the case in Tzimisce politics, many would like nothing more than his fall, first among them his predecessor, Noriz. But Rustovitch is nothing if not a shrewd politician, if he is able to secure some key victories, his rivals could soon 'disappear'... \n\n#bold Can the 'Bane of Wolves' lead the squabbling Tzimisce lords against the threat of the Ventrue and the Tremere usurpers?#!"

 bookmark_warofprinces_mithras_desc:0 "A somewhat mysterious entity, Mithras is believed by some to be a literal Persian and Roman God. Although unlikely, this has allowed him to create a fanatic cadre of zealous childer and cultists to do his bidding. Having fled to England after the failure of some machinations in Ancient Rome, Mithras quickly grew bored of the petty squabbles amongst England's lords. Deciding his time was better spent in slumber, he left the realm in the hands of a few trusted Regents... who promptly let things fall apart. Having risen from his torpor, Mithras was quick to re-consolidate power, fixing most of the mess His regents had made. Now, England is secure, but as of yet not entirely subdued. You will have to deal with savage Gangrel in Wales, rebellious outlaws in Nottingham and the remnants of the Einherjar Vikings in Scotland. After that, the power vacuum in France could be used with your springboard in Bordeaux.\n\n#bold There are no limits in how far you can go. Behold the glory of the undying sun!#!"
