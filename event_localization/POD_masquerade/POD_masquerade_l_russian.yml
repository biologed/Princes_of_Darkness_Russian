 pod_masquerade.1.t:0 "Curiosity killed the Hunter"
 pod_masquerade.1.desc:0 "One of those damnable do-gooders from that group called the Hunters is sniffing around your domain. He's been asking questions about your schedule, influence on the populace and other tricky subjects. If you don't do anything, he will report to his superiors that something about you is off, quite off. There's no doubt in your mind that this will raise suspicions surrounding your court. Thankfully, you know a guy that could deal with this annoyance quickly and quietly, but his services aren't exactly cheap..."
 pod_masquerade.1.a:0 "Money for peace of mind? Easy choice"
 pod_masquerade.1.b:0 "I'm not scared by jumped up mortals"
 pod_masquerade.2.t:0 "Fools, Everywhere!"
 pod_masquerade.2.desc:0 "You are surrounded by idiots and buffoons. You certainly knew that already but what's one more example on your seemingly endless list? A Hunter has lurked in your domain, unnoticed by your people for months now, gathering evidence of your unholy existence. You must deal with him now before he slips away to report to his superiors. And, obviously, the rumor mill will churn out stories of you and your council's incompetence if he should escape..."
 pod_masquerade.2.a:0 "If you want a job done well..."
 pod_masquerade.2.b:0 "Let him flee, you just can't be bothered to care anymore"
 pod_masquerade.3.t:0 "Family Issues"
 pod_masquerade.3.desc:0 "Troublesome reports from one of your agents: A well connected family in town appears to have suspicions as to your true nature. You aren't really sure what went wrong but no Masquerade is perfect after all. You are left with a choice, either deal with the family for good and snuff out this annoyance or just ignore them, risking their continued meddling."
 pod_masquerade.3.a:0 "An unfortunate accident is sure to solve this problem"
 pod_masquerade.3.b:0 "They aren't a threat"
 pod_masquerade.4.t:0 "Family is Family" 
 pod_masquerade.4.desc:0 "A family reunion is quite a rare occurrence in Cainite circles, mostly due to the fact that it could devolve to into a slaughter at any moment. Unfortunately, you have been chosen as the host for the next gathering, which means a lot of Vampires, and a lot of suspicion drawn to you. You could cancel the event, certainly everyone would understand, but going along with it would be a palpable show of confidence on your part."
 pod_masquerade.4.a:0 "I'm not feeling it..."
 pod_masquerade.4.b:0 "Welcome! Please, leave your weapons behind, especially the secret ones."
 pod_masquerade.5.t:0 "A Quick Choice" 
 pod_masquerade.5.desc:0 "As you retract your fangs and wipe some of the blood off your mouth, you look at the corpses of the Hunters who tried to attack you and wonder... Were they badly misinformed about your power? Or just overconfident? Anyway, they are dead now. Except one, who is running away rather quickly actually. You're a bit too bored to feel like chasing after him, he seems nimble and you are above running through the city streets like a madman. But if you don't chase him down, he will surely bring news of this petty scrap to his superiors..."
 pod_masquerade.5.a:0 "Perhaps a nice chase will remind me of the good old days?"
 pod_masquerade.5.b:0 "Well, back to my throne room. I guess."
 pod_masquerade.6.t:0 "Too Good to be True" 
 pod_masquerade.6.desc:0 "The patriarch of an influential family in your area has just passed. His legacy lives on through his two sons and, it just so happens that you have a strong hold on one of them... If you were to help this young man take over the family business, you may stand to reap the benefits, but your strange patronage would certainly raise some eyebrows."
 pod_masquerade.6.a:0 "Nothing more than rats fighting over crumbs"
 pod_masquerade.6.b:0 "We will follow this young man's career with great interest"
 pod_masquerade.7.t:0 "Bad Romance" 
 pod_masquerade.7.desc:0 "You didn't think you had it in you anymore and you're not sure how or why, but... this simple peasant has captivated you for quite some time. Could this be the remnants of mortal lust, or something more? You aren't sure, but tonight, you must make a choice. Will you introduce your newest pet to your court at the risk of breaking the Masquerade? Or will you do the... right thing?"
 pod_masquerade.7.a:0 "Sorry love, it's not me. It's you"
 pod_masquerade.7.b:0 "Welcome to my parlor, light of my night"
 pod_masquerade.8.t:0 "Stretching your Muscles" 
 pod_masquerade.8.desc:0 "The mortals in your area are having one of those silly wars they like so much. Was it about a claim? Religion? Well, no matter, this is an occasion for you to go on the battlefield! Crush some skulls and perhaps learn a thing or two along the way? Obviously, the survivors will likely be somewhat suspicious of your undying prowess..."
 pod_masquerade.8.a:0 "Been there, done that"
 pod_masquerade.8.b:0 "Wait, who am I supposed to be killing again? Oh well."
 pod_masquerade.9.t:0 "Exposed : Hostile Takeover" 
 pod_masquerade.9.desc:0 "Your dealings in the region have finally caught the eye of the Shadow Inquisition. Luckily, it seems that, so far, they are only trying to undermine your authority by targeting your major assets. Several of your agents have gone missing, some of your ghouls replaced by upstanding members of the clergy... and it is starting to put a dent on your rulership.\nYou might try to fight back, but the Inquisition will also certainly up its game if you do."
 pod_masquerade.9.a:0 "The want to play? We will play then..."
 pod_masquerade.9.b:0 "Let's just cut my losses and lay low for a while"
 pod_masquerade.9.a.effect.success.desc:0 "Outmaneuvering the Inquisition will stop their operation against you, for now" 
 pod_masquerade.9.a.success:0 "Back in business!"
 pod_masquerade.9.a.failure.effect.desc:0 "If they succeed, the Inquisition will endanger your influence"
 pod_masquerade.9.a.failure:0 "They have won this battle, but not the war" 
 pod_masquerade.9.a.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "If you make any mistakes, the Inquisition will crush your authority over the region for a long time"
 pod_masquerade.9.a.critical.failure:0 "They have utterly won..." 
 pod_masquerade.10.t:0 "Exposed : Men of Faith" 
 pod_masquerade.10.desc:0 "You always keep an eye on the most faithful mortals in your area as they can easily be the most dangerous ones. Lately, new members of the clergy have appeared and they seem... quite dedicated in their holy work. You are pretty sure that they are an advance force of the hated Inquisition, gathering support among your populace to overthrow your perfectly just rule.\nYou could strike now to remove them, but there is a serious risk that this will backfire. These men already have a strong spiritual hold on the populace..."
 pod_masquerade.10.a:0 "Let's silence these false prophets"
 pod_masquerade.10.b:0 "I can withdraw from mortal affairs for a while"
 pod_masquerade.10.a.effect.success.desc:0 "Outmaneuvering the Inquisition will stop their operation against you, for now" 
 pod_masquerade.10.a.success:0 "Praise me!"
 pod_masquerade.10.a.failure.effect.desc:0 "If they succeed, the Inquisition will endanger your influence"
 pod_masquerade.10.a.failure:0 "They have won this battle, but not the war" 
 pod_masquerade.10.a.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "If you make any mistakes, the Inquisition will crush your authority over the region for a long time"
 pod_masquerade.10.a.critical.failure:0 "They have utterly won..." 
 pod_masquerade.11.t:0 "Exposed : The Battle" 
 pod_masquerade.11.desc:0 "An hostile mortal army is approaching your realm. It isn't uncommon per se, mortals do love their petty wars after all, but this one seems different. Your agents report seeing dedicated men, and an unusual number of clergy members within their ranks. Could you be their true target?\nIt is still time to rally your troops and defend your land... or you could just disappear for a while and weather the storm."
 pod_masquerade.11.a:0 "I fear no battlefield"
 pod_masquerade.11.b:0 "Time for a quick vacation"
 pod_masquerade.11.a.effect.success.desc:0 "Outmaneuvering the Inquisition will stop their operation against you, for now" 
 pod_masquerade.11.a.success:0 "You crushed them, obviously"
 pod_masquerade.11.a.failure.effect.desc:0 "If they succeed, the Inquisition will endanger your influence"
 pod_masquerade.11.a.failure:0 "They have won this battle, but not the war" 
 pod_masquerade.11.a.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "If you make any mistakes, the Inquisition will crush your authority over the region for a long time"
 pod_masquerade.11.a.critical.failure:0 "They have utterly won..." 
 pod_masquerade.12.t:0 "Exposed : Playing the Courts" 
 pod_masquerade.12.desc:0 "Ruling has become surprisingly harder lately. The mortals have come up with new laws and several changes that have been a thorn on your side. You didn't think about it much for a long time but an agent of yours reported that the local mortal ruler has a new adviser, and this one seems to know a lot about you.\nRemoving violently this man would be unwise, as he is a well known figure of mortal politics but... you could discredit him, or outplay him at his own game of influence. Or you could just lay low for a while, mortals will be mortals after all."
 pod_masquerade.12.a:0 "I love a good challenge"
 pod_masquerade.12.b:0 "He can't do much if I stay hidden for a while"
 pod_masquerade.12.a.effect.success.desc:0 "Outmaneuvering the Inquisition will stop their operation against you, for now" 
 pod_masquerade.12.a.success:0 "Total victory!"
 pod_masquerade.12.a.failure.effect.desc:0 "If they succeed, the Inquisition will endanger your influence"
 pod_masquerade.12.a.failure:0 "They have won this battle, but not the war" 
 pod_masquerade.12.a.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "If you make any mistakes, the Inquisition will crush your authority over the region for a long time"
 pod_masquerade.12.a.critical.failure:0 "They have utterly won..." 
 pod_masquerade.13.t:0 "Exposed : Holy Whispers" 
 pod_masquerade.13.desc:0 "When you heard that the Inquisition was planning a move against you, you expected thunder and fury. Instead, you got cloaks and daggers. Your agents are disappearing, trusted contacts turn traitors and rumors are aplenty about your reputation, false or otherwise for that matter.\nYou could strike back, to show these mortals a true master of intrigue. Or you could just let it slide, they will tire of this game soon enough, or better yet, wither and die by themselves like mortals do."
 pod_masquerade.13.a:0 "It is an intriguing challenge to overcome"
 pod_masquerade.13.b:0 "Well, no plotting for a while"
 pod_masquerade.13.a.effect.success.desc:0 "Outmaneuvering the Inquisition will stop their operation against you, for now" 
 pod_masquerade.13.a.success:0 "Total victory!"

 pod_masquerade.13.a.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "If you make any mistakes, the Inquisition will crush your authority over the region for a long time"
 pod_masquerade.13.a.critical.failure:0 "They have utterly won..." 
 pod_masquerade.14.t:0 "Exposed : Holy Fury" 
 pod_masquerade.14.desc:0 "Judging from the cries coming from behind the sealed door of your throne room, your last line of defense is crumbling. No more plotting, hiding or subtle games, the Inquisition has come for you in all its righteous fury.\nAs the whole building is starting to go down in flames, you reassure yourself, they are just jumped up mortals. You can take them on by yourself surely... Or you could use the hidden passage behind your throne to escape and fight another day. No more shouts, and the sound of weapons battering on the door. It's now or never."
 pod_masquerade.14.a:0 "Finally! Worthy opponents!"
 pod_masquerade.14.b:0 "So.. let's just open this secret passage right here..."
 pod_masquerade.14.a.effect.success.desc:0 "Slaughtering the Inquisition will stop their operation against you, for now" 
 pod_masquerade.14.a.success:0 "Not so mighty now"
 pod_masquerade.14.a.failure.effect.desc:0 "Managing to fight your way out will save you at a great cost"
 pod_masquerade.14.a.failure:0 "They have won this battle, but not the war" 
 pod_masquerade.14.a.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "If you make any mistakes, the Inquisition will turn you into ashes"
 pod_masquerade.14.a.critical.failure:0 "...well fought"
