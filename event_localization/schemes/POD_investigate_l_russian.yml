A strong sense of rulership and a devoring ambition were soon born, and Camilla took his [Concept('Sire','Отец')|E]'s throne, some say by [Concept('diablerie','диаблери')|E]. He will then rule Rome from the Republican era to the Imperial one, pioneering the Eternal Senate and the concept of Masquerade. It is also his command that took down the city of Carthage, earning him the enmity of Brujah for all eternity.\n Even more famously, Camilla would fall in with the burgeoning Road of Sin and become one of its more... skillful adepts. Despite his carefree and sometimes indolent attitude, Camilla managed to keep the reins of power over most of the [Concept('cainite','каинит')|E] world for a millenia, a feat never seen before or after. \n He felt into [Concept('torpor','торпор')|E] at the end of the Roman Imperial era, and every semblance of unity in the [Concept('cainite','каинит')|E] world fell with him. He finally awakens in 1230 and easily slips back into power in Rome. But the world has changed much, and it is unlikely that the Prince of Sin will be able to once again rule over Europe. \n Future fate in Canon \n Camilla will fall into [Concept('torpor','торпор')|E] during the Medieval era, only to rise in the early 21th century.

This allowed him to be one of the most powerful Ventrue of the ancient world, especially when his cult spreads to Imperial Rome. \n But Christianity and his many rivals got the better of him, and he fled with his following to the frontiers of the Empire, in Britain. The pettiness of the place quickly bore him and he fell into a cycle of [Concept('torpor','торпор')|E], awakening to find everything in shambles due to incompetent regents, fixing it, and then [Concept('torpor','торпор')|E] again. \n The last cycle was after 1066, when ambitious Norman Vampires ousted his power base from the island, forcing him to awaken once more and deal with it. As of 1230, the Sun God is once again annoyed by Britain and his influence is strong enough that he could consider another retreat into the sleep of ages. Though it is said that the upstart Hardestadt, claiming overlordship over [Concept('clan','клан')|E] Ventrue, is angering his much older clanmate. This could be reason enough for him to stay a little while longer... \n Future fate in Canon \n Mithras will stay awake for some time, being a thorn on the side of Hardestadt during the Camarilla's foundation.

The only thing the stories share is that one way or another he was touched by an incurable madness, but that his dementia allowed him to look past the veil of reality and perceive truths hidden to the eyes of others.\nAfter the fall of the Second City, Malkav is believed to have traveled towards the city of Petra. It is along this journey that some think the Eldest Malkavian was attacked and torn asunder. Who the assailant might have been is unknown, though it seems likely that another [antediluvian|E] sought his destruction. Yet even if his body was destroyed, it is believed that his spirit survived inside of his childer, who gathered at the site of his death and drank his spilled blood, taking Malkav's essence into them and sheltering it from the sun's rays.\nHowever, other accounts state that the Malkavian [antediluvian|E] continues to sleep under Petra, or that he rests beneath Jerusalem. If that is true, his seeping madness could be one cause for the regional instability that has gripped the area for so very long..."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.absimilliard:0 "Tradition holds that Absimilliard was an expert and stealthy hunter whose skill at predation inflamed the dead heart of his female [Concept('Sire','Отец')|E]. She chased and Embraced him, although in the ensuing struggle she also scarred him lightly. A creature of prodigious vanity, this trivial marring of his otherwise perfect looks drove him to obsession, and Absimiliard conceived to murder his sire.\nAbsimiliard is held to be one of the leading figures in the slaughter of the Second Generation, with his vendetta against his sire being the cause of the ensuing violence. As a result, he was harshly punished by Caine, twisted into a hideous mockery of a human being. The curse reverberated through his childer, affecting every one of his descendants.\nSince that time, Absimiliard has hunted his descendants, using blood bound agents, the Nictuku, to hunt down the rest of the line. He plans to present their death as a sacrifice to Caine and beg forgiveness.\nHe is known to have chased Baba Yaga, one of the few childer he hasn't been able to blood bound, to Russia and forced her to some unholy alliances to fend him off. He hasn't been seen since this titanic battle.\nFuture fate in Canon\nAbsimilliard will come back, as petty as ever, taking his revenge on Baba Yaga, trying to murder Toreador because of her beauty and making the unlife of his lineage a living hell."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.zapathasura:0 "The Ravnos [antediluvian|E] is the fabled progenitor of the vampiric [Concept('clan','клан')|E] Ravnos. Its nature is shrouded in lies and half-truths, perhaps even more so than most of the [Concept('antediluvians','допотопные')|E].\nOne tale has him as 'Ravnos', a promising young boy Embraced by Caine himself during a war against the werewolves.\nAnother names him Zapathasura, a monster created by the Gods to hunt down their fallen champions, the Asuratizayya.\nThe last one has him as Churka, Ennoia's brother, embroiled in a long war that he finally won, forcing the Gangrel to flee West and creating an ongoing conflict between the two clans.\nWhatever the truth, he hasn't been seen in centuries, leading most to believe that he is in [Concept('torpor','торпор')|E].\nFuture fate in Canon\nZapathasura will awaken in frenzy in 1999. This awakening will kill most of his clan and almost destroy the whole region. He will be barely stopped by an alliance of the most powerful Asuratizayya and the biggest weapons that the Technocratic Union could find."
 POD_investigate.1.t.saulot:0 "Lore: Saulot"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.saulot:0 "The history of Saulot is obscure, but summarized as follows: in the First City of Enoch, the ancient Enoch Embraced a young man with prophetic gifts. This seer differed from other [Concept('antediluvians','допотопные')|E] in his explicit disquiet with the vampiric state. Still, Saulot had his duties to his kin, and he Embraced a clan of healers, the Salubri. These vampires were unique for their compassion – they were healers of [Concept('cainites','каиниты')|E] and kine, unable to take blood unless freely given.\nIn 1133, the fledgling bloodline of the Tremere sought legitimacy by claiming the blood of an [antediluvian|E] for their own. After much scrying and searching, the mages came on Saulot's torpid form. Unguarded, lord of a relatively passive [Concept('clan','клан')|E], and unable to move, Saulot was the perfect target for the ambitious Tremere. A party of Tremere raided Saulot's tomb and the founder himself drank the [antediluvian|E]'s essence.\nThere are some darker interpretations of Saulot's tale. Saulot's darker history appears in several locations, most notably in the stories about the odd progenitor of the Baali. It is universally accepted that the Baali founders were three demon worshippers who were tossed into an organ pit and thrown some vampire blood, told by a contemptuous vampiric ancient that they understood nothing about the true nature of evil. The Baali claim that elder was Saulot.\nFuture fate in Canon\nSaulot will take back control of his body from Tremere in 1995. As befitting his legend, he will then be seen as both a savior and a monster once more."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.set:0 "In contrast to the other [Concept('antediluvians','допотопные')|E], Set's story doesn't acknowledge Caine in any way, instead drawing heavily from Egyptian myth. Set was born in Egypt, on the Nile River. He was a great hunter and warrior whose only rival was his elder brother, Osiris. They were the grandchildren of Ra, a mighty chieftain who had conquered the people of the Nile, thus uniting Upper and Lower Egypt. As the legend continues, Set returned to Egypt and struck down King Osiris and his son Horus. Taking Egypt as his own, Set ruled in power – and perhaps (or perhaps not) sought to free mankind from the bonds of law imposed by Ra.\nThere are some Setites who reject the notion that their 'Founder' was ever mortal, or even embraced. Instead, there is the belief that Set, Osiris, Isis, and Horus were all truly gods. This belief has permeated the Setites for millennia now, and made them more of a religious cult than a true [clan] in a sense. While Set himself hasn't been awake since 33 BCE, his childer are preparing for his glorious return and the day when he will make his followers ascend... or eat them all to power himself up, depending on the interpretation.\nFuture fate in Canon\nSet's sarcophagus will be attacked during the Anarch Revolt but he will manage to defend himself. In the modern nights, the faithful Setites are seeing more and more signs of their God's impending return..."

She is generally held to be beautiful, fickle, vain and carrying on affairs with the other [Concept('antediluvians','допотопные')|E]. She may be especially despised by Absimiliard, who both lusted for her and sought (and still seeks) to destroy her. When Caine returned to the [Concept('antediluvians','допотопные')|E], who at the time resided in the Second City, to curse them, he (according to the Toreador) spared Arikel whom he believed was innocent in the matter.\nRecords then place her as a Goddess in Sumer, until a conflict with Ennoia drove her off. She resurfaces in Crete, as the [Concept('Sire','Отец')|E] of the Minotaur (a vampire having fallen to his Beast in this tale), then in Syracuse, as an advisor to Prince Alchias, before disappearing from history.\nFuture fate in Canon\nArikel narrowly avoids an attack by Absimilliard in the final nights and is now residing in Crete, being one of the few [Concept('antediluvians','допотопные')|E] not hell bent on destroying or conquering the world."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.tremere:0 "Tremere is a powerful mage turned vampire. While he was mortal he was one of the founders of the Order of Hermes and creator of House Tremere, that would eventually become the vampiric [Concept('clan','клан')|E] Tremere.\nAn eastern European mage who was known for being cold-blooded, brilliant, and a radical, he was the youngest and weakest of the Order's founders, and compensated by establishing a strict, militaristic culture for his House, structured like a pyramid.\nHe tested many spells to create eternal life, but found them all fatally flawed. Finally, he concluded that the only form of immortality, without severely degrading the use of magic, was vampirism. After becoming a [Concept('cainite','каинит')|E], he diablerised Saulot in 1133 CE. After the diablerie, Tremere was almost immediately knocked into a torpor lasting centuries. His body underwent grotesque physical mutations, including growing extra eyes and his limbs retracting into his body. He is able to surface only briefly to guide the clan, though it is unknown how much of the guidance is from him, or the soul of Saulot speaking through him.\nFuture fate in Canon\nTremere will finally lose the battle against Saulot. He will have to possess Goratrix' body to make sure his soul survives. To this night, he is still 'Goratrix' and leading the small House of the same name, a mere shadow of the power he once held."

It then used the part of its own essence invested into its childer and reformed itself in the bowels of the Dracon.

In one account, Caine saw the potential in Ventru when he was still a youth and took him in, raising him as his own and eventually giving him to Enoch for his Embrace.\nVentru became Caine's right hand and enforcer under the office of the Hand of Caine, and served as Enoch's proxy among the populace of the First City. After the Flood, the thirteen [Concept('antediluvians','допотопные')|E] rose up against their sires and slew them. Ventru, like the other [Concept('antediluvians','допотопные')|E] (except perhaps Saulot), was punished by Caine with his distinctive clan weakness for his role in the uprising.\nIn the latter days of the Second City, Ventru was forced to again take up the role of the Hand of Caine as his siblings warred against his rule and against one another in the first stirrings of the Jyhad. After Troile's diablerie of Brujah, Ventru departed the Second City in search of Caine. However, he was struck down outside the gates of the city by one of his siblings (presumably Troile, or possibly Lasombra, Set, or even one of his own childer). However, as Ventru probably sired later methuselahs such as Arakur of Ur and Alexander, some claim he must have survived that attack in some form.\nFuture fate in Canon\nVentru never came back, leaving his ultimate fate a mystery."
