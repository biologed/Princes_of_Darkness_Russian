Energies of creation permeate the world, flowing to and from the Yin and Yang Worlds. Called Chi, this energy flows through and among all the Ten Thousand Things.\n\nLike Kindred, Wan-Kuei suffer from hunger. When a Wan-Kuei has five or fewer Chi points (of either sort) in their body, they becomes hungry.\n\nA Wan-Kuei's Chi Virtues indicate how much of a given type of Chi the Wan-Kuei may safely channel through her body. The Wan-Kuei is easily capable of ingesting more temporary Chi than her Chi Virtues indicate (a permanent imbalance allows to ingest more Chi of that type without ill effects). However, a Wan-Kuei who abuses this practice runs the risk of an imbalance - a dangerous 'overdose' of Chi. Wan-Kuei with none of aparticular type of Chi in her body is thrown in an automatic state of temporary imbalance too."
