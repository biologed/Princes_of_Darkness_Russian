 POD_soulmate_frenzy.001.t:0 "The Frayed Soul"
 POD_soulmate_frenzy.001.desc:0 "You just learned the announcement and your world is collapsing. [lost_soulmate.GetFirstName] has embraced true death. Your mind shakes, and denies this fact. You need endless moments before really understanding what it means : a part of you is definitely gone. You're alone under the night sky, and this vertiginous solitude strangles your mind. But there is a monster which watches for your weakness. The Beast rises inside you, riding your pain and despair. Soon, its roars will besiege your soul. Because with sorrow comes the rage."

 POD_soulmate_frenzy.002.desc:0 "A terrifying presence grows inside you. It's full of red passions, of deadly desires, and you would like to give in. You could forget all your sufferings, and find relief by welcoming the Beast. A breath, while you're suffocating with your pain. But you have your own reasons to resist. You know the Beast is an inner predator, and you are its prey.\nThere is nothing good it can give you, if it is more despair. And so, you fight against the Beast, you fight against yourself and your own wish to give-up. Your mind is a battleground, and the light is fading. You are alone against your own darkness, and this one swallows you."

 POD_soulmate_frenzy.102.desc:0 "The following nights seem to never end. The Beast is here, ready to exploit the slightest annoyance, the slightest sob, to take hold of you. Your courtiers feel something is wrong with you, and hopefully, they instinctively avoid you. Your gaze is full of carnage, and even a human can see it. Little by little however, you push back your inner monster. Its claws can no longer find a grip on your consciousness. And so, after weeks of hard struggle, you lock the beast in its cage again. You have won, but at the cost of great effort. At least, many lives were probably saved because of it.\nYour sorrow is still here, and your immortality has a bitter taste. But time is nevertheless your ally. Maybe, one night, the skies will be starry again."

 POD_soulmate_frenzy.003.desc:0 "You manage to keep the bridle of the Beast, at least for a while. You leave your domain, like Hell was behind you. You engage in the night, as far from your home as you can, whereas the Beast strikes inside you with fury. At one point, you don't really remember when, you do the only thing left to do : you open the cage. And you drown in the torment of your too long contained emotions.\nA lot of people will probably die, but they won't be your courtiers."

Quickly, rumors speak about a monster which comes at night, killing anything on its path. The days become too short for the people, and the nights, deadly promises.\nYou don't remember when it stops. You just standing in the center of a village, and the pieces of its inhabitants are scattered all around you. This image has become familiar to you, but now, you can appreciate the horror of it. Finally, you come to your refuge. Your inner truth is expressed by the dried blood smearing your face and your hands. You are the monster of the tales, and children will grow up fearing you."

 POD_soulmate_frenzy.203.desc:0 "The great frenzy did not appease your pain. Mourning is not done with rage and carnage. You feel empty, assailed by an impression of unreality.

Quickly, rumors speak about a monster which comes at night, killing anything on its path. The days become too short for the people, and the nights, deadly promises.\nBut sometimes, even the monsters meet their own boogeyman. Your Beast has been too noisy, too visible by its appetite for death. Several beings have heard the tears of the earth. They smelled the scent of your carnage and followed its trail. One night, they finally find you, and you become the prey. A pack of werewolves suddenly surrounds you, and they are determined to end your sacrilegious existence. Despite all the power of your rage, theirs fangs and their claws are too many. This could be your last fight."

Your Beast does not have the slightest discernment, but it knows instinctively how to kill and survive. You stand in the heart of the battle; your dance in the middle of the feral tempest. You dodge some hits, you fail for others, and for each new wound, your raging grows again and again.\nIn your fevered mind you see yourself grab the flesh that passes within your reach, burst the eyes, wrench the jaws and slice arms like the heads. The pain comes to tear these visions. Your body has limits and all the rage in the world can't get past them. The fatigue and your injuries are getting way too great; and the fear takes over the monster that controls you. So, you run away, despite the mad werewolves chasing you. After hours of chase, by some kind of miracle, you manage to escape them."

This thing, which is you without being you, runs across your domain. It is blind to regret, merely concerned to give death, because death gave birth to it. So its claws strike faces and crush bones; and its teethes tear off throats, like the hearts from the chest.\nYour house is now submerged with blood and screams. The night will soon be silent again.
