 pod1230objectives.1.desc:0 "Most of you have long heard the false tale of the Persian 'God', Mithras, of his unending exploits and ambitions for the isles. Tonight, you will hear the whole, sad truth. Mithras wanted us to think he came to the British Isles as a savior, but the truth is, he was fleeing from his failures in Ancient Rome, seeing our homeland as a backwater barely fit enough to rebuild his power base. Now, he has failed once more, as Britannia is under a new, united leadership. His cult scatters, driven out by fire and sword and destined to become a mere footnote of the isles' history. As I proclaim to you the fall of the 'Unconquered Sun', I also proclaim that Britannia is finally ready to become its own driving force in Cainite society."

The sheer charisma and power of the entity known as a God to ancient Persians and Romans is still staggering and, even though mortals have moved on, a shift of paradigm has recently occurred. With the lack of any credible rivals to the mantle of Ventrue leadership, the cult of Mithras has managed to gather sufficient influence to, in a way, become clan Ventrue itself. No longer confined to Britannia, the faithful of the Unconquered Sun are more powerful than ever and their undeniable faith is shaking Vampire's tenets to the core. The Biblical origin story is starting to fade from younger vampires memories, replaced by inspiring tales of undying champions faithful to the Warrior Sun-God. Kindred society will never be the same."

As they enter your richly decorated throne room, you ask yourself how many will have propositions, threats or daggers waiting for you before the end of the night. You also idly wonder, was this Michael's plan all along? Did he know that his Dream required a change of leadership, a fresh vision? You will probably never know. What you do know is that your illustrious guests all want to learn something tonight and their gifts are a part of this scheme. Michael, self proclaimed Archangel, would have refused such worldly offerings or even be offended by them. If you refuse as well, you will truly be seen as Michael’s Heir.

As a matter of fact, the coveted position of master of the Sea of Shadows, and thus all of clan Lasombra, has been offered to you. It is obviously a trap, and they all expect you to fail miserably. For your reign to end as quickly as it began so they may return to their petty squabbles without you standing in their way. But this won't happen. You intend to make them regret their futile scheming. You have tamed Iberia after all, bending the Mediterranean and a few decrepit elders to your will can't be any more difficult... Right?"

As the invasion of the German Ventrue collapses, and proud Einherjar once again instill terror in the hearts of the Children of Caine, the faith is reborn anew. Under a new leader, with new doctrines and leadership, the Einherjar are now something greater than even Odin could have imagined, the Wanderer chooses them well, and they are now his family, the Aesir of tomorrow.

It was a sordid period for the Faithful at the start, with betrayals, fallen cities and darker secrets conspiring to bring down the Midnight Crescent. As such, your victory was most unexpected. As the mortal Iberian Taifas fall one after another, the Ashirra faithful still managed to overcome their northern Christian neighbors. It is a strange turn of events indeed. As the Sea of Shadows crumbles because of their misguided alliance with the Christians, you now rule over a new, barely recognizable land and people. In a way, your victory saved the last relic of the Muslim golden age in Iberia. You are as much victors as you are caretakers of a rich history.

You see yourself, anointed Head of the illustrious Giovanni family in your Italian stronghold. You see your small council of trusted family members, helping you plan your great conspiracy. You see the night of Europe redefined by your growing merchant empire, all clans begrudgingly accepting your new presence, your wise counsel and your newfound importance, a far cry from the uselessness of your Cappadocian brothers. You see the Conspiracy put in motion, using all your assets to make it the resounding success it deserves to be. As you come back to your senses, and the fool is reduced to ashes, you see your family… no, your Clan… around you. The night is young. And it will be Giovanni’s."

But, in the wake of your fight against the princes of the night, many have gathered to join your cause. Some follow your lead, while others have begun to experiment with new political constructs. It is a strange new night indeed, as you find yourself in the position of a respected peacekeeper between the various factions coming to life. You are no old fashioned ruler, but the solid rock that defends the Free States from counterattacks and mortal interference. It is a precarious position of dubious honor, framed with dangers and threats at every edge. But, really, there is no other place you would prefer to be right now."

There will be no respite until all of Europe praises His glorious name, then, and only then, will He bless us with His return! … Come, children, let us pray in the temple for the coming of this glorious time.

But, along the way, you have lost so much more. Saulot was a caretaker, a kind soul, who would have shed so many tears for the sacrifices, the blood and the pain your have brought in your path. They call you ‘The Avenging Angel’, for you have been without mercy and, perhaps, have been true to the rumors the Tremere told about your clan. You are the sword of the Salubri, the light of the clan. But you are also lost, soulless, and the greatest threat to your own people now that your foes have been dealt with.

For the first time, a Ravnos holds considerable power in the west, and can challenge even its well entrenched Cainite ruling class. Better yet, this has caught the eye of your clansmen in India, who have sent ambassadors to praise their wayward kin and call for an alliance. Some would ask though...

At times, we have been pushed to the brink of extinction by the demonic pacts they so easily make. But now, India awakens. Be they Ravnos, Nagaraja or Danava, the native Cainites are finding strength and unity of purpose anew. Make no mistake though, the Eternal War won't be over until no Wan Kuei dare roam our lands.
