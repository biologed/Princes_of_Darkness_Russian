 PODinquisition.0001.t:0 "Age of the Inquisition"
 PODinquisition.0001.desc:0 "Worrying reports have come to your attention. The so called 'Shadow Inquisition' seems to have had enough of the Shadow part of its title. They are suddenly gathering support among the mortals rulers and institutions, which has caused a ripple effect around the world. This move has been planned for decades, perhaps centuries and all their attacks so far have been mere containment missions and information gathering expeditions. The real extent of the conspiracy targeting Vampires might be way bigger than you ever anticipated. \n Everywhere, mortals are arming themselves behind gifted Hunters, determined in bringing down the monsters of the night that have been plagued them for so long.\n Retribution is coming."
 PODinquisition.0001.a:0 "This will blow over, surely."
 PODinquisition.0001.b:0 "To arms brothers and sisters! Let us finish the hunt!"
 PODinquisition.1001.t:0 "The Inquisition : France"
 PODinquisition.1001.desc:0 "It is here that the Inquisition started.\nDuring the Cathar uprising, many men of the cloth found their way in Southern France, looking for heretics. They found so much more. Cainite France was embroiled in an intrigue between Paris and Toulouse, and both sides were glad to use the mortals and the uprising to their own advantage.\nThey didn't expect the sheer faith and determination of the Church. Vampires were killed in drove during the Albigensian Crusade, and the information was brought back to the Holy See about this new threat. The rest is History.\n As such, it is of little surprise that France is a major and early target of the open Inquisition going on around the world now."
 PODinquisition.1001.a:0 "The Cross has come to purge France once again"
 PODinquisition.1001.player_warning:0 "Not much more time left to prepare"
 PODinquisition.1002.t:0 "The Inquisition : Britain"
 PODinquisition.1002.desc:0 "The Inquisition always had trouble working in England. Mithras' hold on the country, and the insularity of the people here, made it difficult for the agents of God to accomplish their holy mission. They never relented though, and an adequate solution was found : using the Breton Order of the Ermine as a staging ground for the purge of England.\nAnd so, it has begun, behind their Grandmistress, loyal and pious Bretons and Britons march together towards the process of cleansing the isles. It is a total assault, the Church has no reserves and intend on striking decisively on the bloodsuckers' holdout. If this bold tactic works, England might still be saved."
 PODinquisition.1002.a:0 "It seems that the Church will never relent, even here"
 PODinquisition.1003.t:0 "The Inquisition : Germany"
 PODinquisition.1003.desc:0 "Although France is where the true origin of the Inquisition lies, Germany is its beating heart. Once the early medieval Shadow Inquisition started to dissolve, it was an Austrian nobleman, Leopold von Murnau, who gathered all who heed the call of God into his secret society. This 'Society of Leopold' has been the leading force behind the Church assault for centuries, and is now preparing its final assault.\nThe Society isn't a military force though, and, after some compromises, it will be up to the Teutonic Order to purge the minions of Hell from the Holy Roman Empire. Duly informed of the prowess of their foes, the Knights have now gained a foothold in Dortmund, from which they plan to expand slowly but surely the righteous fury of God."
 PODinquisition.1003.a:0 "Are the Teutons up to this monumental task?"
 PODinquisition.1005.t:0 "The Inquisition : Iberia"
 PODinquisition.1005.desc:0 "Iberia has always been a center of faith. As such, military orders are aplenty, which presented a very solid opportunity for the Shadow Inquisition. It was easy enough convincing the various orders of the necessity to purge Iberia of bloodsuckers, but it was harder to make them actually work together.\nThe Church used the figure of Rodrigue de Navarre, the founder of the earliest branch of the Inquisition, as a rallying point for the Iberians. This scheme proved to work well, and it is an immense force of knights of the Cross that is now amassing in Portugal to start the liberation of Iberia. With all the Kingdoms and Orders working hand in hand finally, it seems that the Inquisition's victory here is assured."
 PODinquisition.1005.a:0 "It was expected"
 PODinquisition.1006.t:0 "The Inquisition : Scandinavia"
 PODinquisition.1006.desc:0 "The Inquisition's reach on Scandinavia has always been poor. The land is harsh, divided, and even the most zealous inquisitors actually doubt that the Cainites can really prosper here. As such, targeting this area wasn't in the initial plan of the Holy See.\nIt is the dedication and the true faith of one northerner, Albjorn, that changed his Holiness' mind. Albjorn pleaded his case, describing the insidious hold of the vampires on the good flock of Scandinavia, especially in the far North. Convinced, Rome has now see fit to arm a solid expedition to help Albjorn in his quest. Time will tell if this was a good choice or not."
 PODinquisition.1006.a:0 "The Cross reaches even the edge of the world"
 PODinquisition.1007.t:0 "The Inquisition : Italy"
 PODinquisition.1007.desc:0 "It should be no surprise that the Inquisition has kept his best troops for Italy itself. Long corrupted by the cursed children of Caine, the Holy See wants to unleash a retribution on the Italian ones not seen since the Biblical flood.\nJean de Lastic, the famous defender of Rhodes and grandmaster of the Knights Hospitalier, is tasked with burning down every vampire he can find. And he has been assigned a formidable force to help him in this godly endeavor. As far as the Holy See is concerned, the whole world hangs in the balance of the Italian battle. There will be compromises, no surrender and no mercy. Italy will be saved, as God demands it."
 PODinquisition.1007.a:0 "If this the end of the Italian Cainites?"
 PODinquisition.1008.t:0 "The Inquisition : Levant"
 PODinquisition.1008.desc:0 "The Crusader States are long gone in the Levant, but the Church never forgot the disturbing reports that came from them. It was clear that, even in this most holiest of land, the cursed Cainites rule the night.\nMouting an attack here was always a tough prospect for the Shadow Inquisition, as the land was in hostile hands but... these hostile hands are still human. And so, a long and arduous diplomatic process begun, where the best negotiators of Italy working day and night to convince their past foes to let them operate in the Levant. They finally managed to sway them and, as the Inquisition rises everywhere, a dedicated contingent of holy knights stand poised to save the Holy Land from the most foul of threats."
 PODinquisition.1008.a:0 "In the Holy Land, the Cainites have united the mortals against them"
 PODinquisition.1009.t:0 "The Inquisition : Arabia"
 PODinquisition.1009.desc:0 "Although the Muslim world lacks a long tradition of holy orders, it doesn't mean that it is blind to the Cainite threat. For a long time, Mecca itself served as a perfect protection, repelling the monsters by the sheer faith emanating from it. But times are changing, and the crafty bloodsuckers seem to have devised a countermeasure.\nAll is not lost however, as a small family of like-minded tribesmen has taken upon themselves to organize the hunt. Quickly growing thanks to their considerable records so far, this new society, the Ikhwan al-Safa, is now strong enough to launch a major assault on known Cainite positions."
 PODinquisition.1009.a:0 "The scorching sun might be the end of the Arabian Kindred"
 PODinquisition.1010.t:0 "The Inquisition : Persia"
 PODinquisition.1010.desc:0 "An exception in the wider Muslim world, hunters were never really able to take roots in Persia, with the total control of the Haqimite Clan in the region being the most likely culprit. Though an organization isn't the only thing that matters to a dedicated hunter. As such, individuals, or even small bands, were always a thorn on the side of the Children of Caine here.\nAs the rest of the world is engulfed in the mortal counterattack, an hasty alliance of several small groups has been formed in Persia, to profit from the surrounding chaos and, hopefully, strike a crippling blow to the monsters of the night."
 PODinquisition.1010.a:0 "Persia is older than most humans realize"
 PODinquisition.1011.t:0 "The Inquisition : India"
 PODinquisition.1011.desc:0 "India has a long tradition of monster hunting. Oftentimes though, this tradition has been used as a font by groups not much better than the preys themselves and this practice has severely hampered the creation of an unified organization, like what happened in Europe.\nAs such, even as the western world bursts into flames, India stands relatively untouched by the chaos. Small reports indicate a congregation of like minded hunters around Sindh however, which might warrant some caution from the true rulers of India."
 PODinquisition.1011.a:0 "Nothing really changes in the land of the Eternal War"
 PODinquisition.1012.t:0 "The Inquisition : Maghreb"
 PODinquisition.1012.desc:0 "Far from the reach of the Christian Inquisition, the Maghreb is still looking at the massive assault on the Cainites with interest. Having long been plagued by the same threat, its inhabitants have formed a tradition of solitary hunters, the Sayyad al-Ghulan.\nThese hunters are now, for the first time, looking to band together, hoping to take advantage of the European chaos to hunt those Cainites who will seek refuge in their shores."
 PODinquisition.1012.a:0 "No refuge for vampires here"
 PODinquisition.1013.t:0 "The Inquisition : Egypt"
 PODinquisition.1013.desc:0 "The Egyptians have been aware of the presence of monsters for a very long time now. It was Baybars himself, the first Mamluk Sultan, that uncovered the truth about the snake worshipers hiding in their land. The purge he orchestrated is still felt today by the Setites but, sadly, Baybars' himself was killed by one of their agents.\nSince then, the Cainites have been coming back to their temples, recovering their lost strength. But in the midst of the European uprising against this foe, the legacy of Baybars is carried on by a massive group of young Mamluks, determined to avenge their fallen forefather."
 PODinquisition.1013.a:0 "Can the Serpents endure this storm once more?"
 PODinquisition.1014.t:0 "The Inquisition : Transylvania"
 PODinquisition.1014.desc:0 "To this night, the Church is still shocked at the sheer number of reports of vampires crawling around in Transylvania. With some of them acting like literal nobles, or even worse, Gods! Sadly for the Shadow Inquisition, the disputed religious landscape of this area never allowed them to truly take hold and contain the situation here.\nSo they had to do something new, and this has come in the form of 'delegating' the purging task to the Order of the Dragon. This chivalric society knows a surprising amount about vampires and such, and has made so far great allies for the Inquisition. But, in the corners of Rome, some suspect that a closer look at them might be necessary after their task is done..."
 PODinquisition.1014.a:0 "Dragons against Vampires"
 PODinquisition.1015.t:0 "The Inquisition : Greece"
 PODinquisition.1015.desc:0 "The Shadow Inquisition has known of the presence of bloodsuckers in Greece since the 4th Crusade, for which they are obviously to blame. How else could it have gone so wrong otherwise? For a long time, the Latin Empire was intended as a base to strike when the Inquisition reveal itself but... this part of the plan has obviously gone wrong.\nHis Holiness hasn't forgotten the Christian souls of the east, wayward as they might be. As such, he recently created the Order of Our Lady of Bethlehem, with the righteous task of purging the foul Cainites from these lost lands. Then, perhaps, can Byzantium be truly saved in soul if not in body."
 PODinquisition.1015.a:0 "The Franks are back in Eastern Rome"
 PODinquisition.1016.t:0 "The Inquisition : Russia"
 PODinquisition.1016.desc:0 "The Orthodox Church has its own inquisitorial body, the group of hunters known as the Akritai. Respected even by the Shadow Inquisition for its relentless pursuit of justice, the Akritai were privy of their western counterparts' plan for a grand offensive against the undead.\nIt took some convincing and negotiation, but they finally agreed to participate in it, gathering information about Russian Cainites and their agents. This intelligence will come into good use now, as the Exarch of the Akritai himself is taking the field near Moscow to launch the most important offensive of their organization yet."
 PODinquisition.1016.a:0 "From Russia they come..."
 PODinquisition.1017.t:0 "The Inquisition : Eastern Europe"
 PODinquisition.1017.desc:0 "The Shadow Inquisition is conflicted about Eastern Europe. Although the large presence of pagans in time past seems to indicate Cainites' influence, they had trouble actually confirming that theory. As such, Rome decided to play the long game, by creating the Order of Dobrzyn two centuries ago.\nThese knights have kept a low profile, even being officially disbanded after a while but their true task is only beginning now. Gathering a group of dedicated warriors of the faith, and helped by the long reach of the Shadow Inquisition network, the Order is launching his full blown attack on the unholy abominations as part of the great Inquisition Crusade against the vampires."
 PODinquisition.1017.a:0 "Even forgotten orders come back to fight!"
