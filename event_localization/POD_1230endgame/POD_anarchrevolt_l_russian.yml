 PODanarchrevolt.0002.desc:0 "As the fires of the Inquisition rage across Europe, things are getting even worse. Younger vampires, angry to be used as very flammable meat shields against the soldiers of God, have risen up against their Elders in what is quickly being known as the Anarch Revolt.\nIt is so far mostly concerning neonates, Furores and Brujah with a few opportunists thrown in, but some are worried that it could continue to snowball if nothing is done about it. These Anarchs are weak individually, but they fight relentlessly for something rare for a Kindred : a cause."

 PODanarchrevolt.0004.t:0 "The Revolt : Death of Lasombra"
 PODanarchrevolt.0004.desc:0 "Although many are hard pressed to believe it, it seems that a cataclysmic event happened in Castel del Ombro recently. The center of power of Clan Lasombra has been the target of a daring assault lead by a group of Lasombra Anarchs helped by some of the best agents of the dreaded Assamite Warrior caste.\nThe reports of the actual assault are sketchy, and only one Lasombra emerged alive from the fortress but if he is to be believed... Lasombra himself is dead. This event has emboldened the Anarchs everywhere, and a large majority of Clan Lasombra has now rallied to the cause of the rebellious childer. The Anarch Revolt is heating up night after night."
 PODanarchrevolt.0004.a:0 "They will learn their place!"

 PODanarchrevolt.0006.t:0 "The Revolt : Death of Absimilliard"
 PODanarchrevolt.0006.desc:0 "The impossible has happened.\nIn one of the deepest forest of Russia, a group of Anarch Nosferatu managed to track down what they claimed to be the resting place of the monstrous progenitor of their clan, Absimilliard. After a terrible battle against the guardians of the tomb, only one of the assailants remained but he has, if he is to be believed, slain the Antediluvian in his sleep. All around the world, Clan Nosferatu is finally breathing free for the first time since its creation and is massively joining the Anarch cause to honor their savior.\nAnd, all across Russia, the maniacal laugh of an old lady can be heard night after night since the event..."

 PODanarchrevolt.0008.t:0 "The Revolt : Death of Ennoia"
 PODanarchrevolt.0008.desc:0 "Grave news coming from the frozen North, the Anarch Gangrel pack that left to track down Ennoia, the progenitor of their clan, has returned. Or at least one of them.\nThis harrowed, but proud, survivor spins tales of wonders and monsters, of betrayals and battles worthy of Ragnarok itself. But, at the end, the warrior talks about the death of Ennoia herself, killed in her torpored sleep after the terrible fight against her tomb's guardians. Obviously, it is incredibly difficult to verify such claims but they already had a powerful ripple effect in the Gangrel Clan as many of them have joined the Anarch cause. The revolt is heating up night after night."

 PODanarchrevolt.0010.t:0 "The Revolt : Death of Tzimisce"
 PODanarchrevolt.0010.desc:0 "It happened again.\nA group of Tzimisce anarchs has made a raid against some elders of their clan, with the ostensible goal of securing the resting place of the Antediluvian. After acquiring this information, their army marched on the Monastery of Semog and a terrible battle ensued with the defending Szlachta. Emerging victorious, the Anarchs somehow managed to dispel the magical protections of the tomb and their leader greedily consumed Tzimisce himself.\nThis stunning victory has plunged the old clan into the hands of the Revolt, claiming their place as one of the few lineage that managed to get rid of its progenitor."

 PODanarchrevolt.0012.t:0 "The Revolt : Death of Arikel"
 PODanarchrevolt.0012.desc:0 "Arikel, the progenitor of the Toreador clan, always appeared aloof from the Great Game played by the Antediluvians. It hasn't been enough to shield her from the Anarch Revolt though.\nReports have come to you that a daring force of Toreador anarchs has attacked her haven in Crete, apparently helped by information provided by some old Nosferatus. The rest of the story is confusing, with some surviving members claiming that Arikel was asleep, while others speak of a great battle, but they all are in agreement saying that the Bull-Dancer of Enoch has fallen to her own lineage.\nEmboldened by this news, clan Toreador is now taking a much more active role in the Anarch Revolt."

 PODanarchrevolt.0014.t:0 "The Revolt : Death of Ventru"
 PODanarchrevolt.0014.desc:0 "Even the clan of Kings isn't spared by the madness of the Anarch Revolt. Somewhere deep in Persia, a coterie of Ventrue anarchs stumbled upon an Antediluvian's tomb. Some say they were looking for Haqim, the Assamite's progenitor, and were misled by his cunning childer, some others are simply talking about an obvious and quite crude powergrab.\nWhatever the actual reason, these Ventrue have returned, claiming the kill of their long missing progenitor. Although dubious, this claim has led many Ventrue into the Anarch Revolt, where they easily slip into leadership positions. Most Anarchs are concerned that this is a threat to the actual ideology of the Revolt, but they aren't really in a position to deny such a powerful helping hand reaching for them."
